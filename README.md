# SierraCSharpRestClient
A strongly typed interface for Innovative's Sierra RESTful interface in C# for .Net.

The Sierra REST API provides access to the Sierra library platform database. It is intended for the use of Innovative customers and their authorized third-party associates, as well as Innovativeâ€™s commercial partners.

The Sierra REST API is a Representational State Transfer (REST) API service that provides JSON or XML responses and employs predictable, resource-oriented URLs. The system returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.
Swagger is here:

This version deals explicitly with the PATRON branch, however, the base Sierra Client Interface will accept any branch you build for it. 

Our requirement at the University of London was for a strongly typed interface, so I use some mapping.
